I have a deep interest in combining creativity and technology, which has driven my passion for both graphic design and programming.</tr>
	    	<tr style="width: 500px;">Despite having grown up in a challenging family environment that didn’t offer much support, I’ve developed a strong passion for music, playing both the guitar and piano. I also enjoy drawing and painting, although I often struggle with dissatisfaction in my artistic creations.</tr>
